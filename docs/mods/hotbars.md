# Hotbars: macro bars by job

Hotbars is a bundled mod (from Arusia's VCHotbar, PR #88): up to three bars of up to twelve slots over the chat
window. Each slot holds a macro of as many lines as you like. Its action's icon shows on the slot (the first spell,
ability, weapon skill or item a line names), with a shade and the time left while it recasts; a slot with no action
shows its label. Turn it on in Config → Extras, on its page (Hotbars), where its size and place are set too.

## Sets

Macros load by job. A **main set** (`WAR`) loads whenever that job is your main job; a **sub set** (`WAR` with sub
`NIN`) loads on top of it when you play WAR/NIN, slot by slot. Slots the main set fills have a gold edge, those the
sub set fills a blue one. Clearing a slot of a sub set the main set fills blanks it for that sub job only.

## On the bars

- **Keys:** bar 1 takes `1`..`0`, `-`, `=`; bar 2 the same with Ctrl, bar 3 with Alt. The manager's Config page picks
  each bar's modifier and the key row (number row, function keys or the numpad), and any slot's own key. A slot shows
  its key in its corner.
- **Click** a slot to run it; **right-click** for its menu: a spell, an ability, an existing macro or one from the
  library, Edit the macro (in the manager's Builder), Clear, its own key, the manager; **drag** a slot onto another to
  swap them (in the sub set when either comes from it).
- **Hover** a slot for its name and lines.
- The jobs over the top bar open the manager.

The game's macro palette hides while the bars show (Hide Stock Macro Bar); its Ctrl and Alt keys still run its
macros unless a bar uses them.

## Macros

Each line runs as typed. `/wait 2` on its own line waits two seconds; `<wait 2>` at the end of a line waits after it.
A macro still running ignores a second press.

## The library, the Builder and the palette

Each main job has a **library** of macros (`//hb`, Library: New, Edit, Copy, Delete). A slot can name a library
macro instead of holding its own copy, so editing the macro changes every slot (main or sub set) that names it.

The **Builder** makes one: pick a type (spell, job ability, weapon skill, pet command, item, equipment, a system
command such as `/attack`, `/heal`, `/assist` or `/lockon`, or Macro for typed lines only), search, pick, choose
the target, and add lines to run after it. System commands show a game icon standing in for them (a sword for
`/attack`, Regen for `/heal`). Edit the macro on a slot opens the Builder on it; Save puts it in the library and on
that slot.

The **palette** (`//hb palette`, or Palette on the Library page) shows the main job's library as tiles on the screen;
drag its background to move it. Drag a tile onto a slot of the bars to put that macro there; click one to edit it.

The manager's **Config** page sets each bar's modifier and key row, and a slot's own key.

The macros are kept in `mod-data/hotbar/files/macros.json`:

```json
{
  "WAR": {
    "library": { "1": { "name": "Provoke", "action": { "kind": "ja", "name": "Provoke", "target": "t" },
                        "lines": ["/p Provoked <t>"] } },
    "main": { "1": { "1": { "ref": "1" }, "2": { "name": "Berserk", "lines": ["/ja \"Berserk\" <me>"] } } },
    "sub": { "NIN": { "1": { "6": { "name": "Utsusemi", "lines": ["/ma \"Utsusemi: Ichi\" <me>"] } } } }
  }
}
```

## Commands

- `//hb` opens or closes the manager.
- `//hb show`, `//hb hide`: the bars for this session.
- `//hb palette` shows or hides the palette.
- `//hb run <bar> <slot>`: runs a slot (for a key bind).
- `//hb reload`: reads macros.json again.
- `//hb wipestock` empties the game's own macro sets after keeping a copy; `//hb restorestock` puts it back.
